# Season 2 Updates and Character Announcements

**Overview of Season 2 Content**  
- Today’s big Season 2 content will cover four parts: character updates, balance adjustments, ranked matches, and new features.  

**Character Announcements: Return of Anna and New Character**  
- One of the Season 2 characters is Anna, who is returning.  
- The official release for Anna will be on April 4th (April 3rd in the US), with a 72‑hour early access available for Season 2 Pass holders.  
- Anna’s new design features a transforming mechanism—she has been shown firing bazookas since Tekken 5, now enhanced by a unique “Lovely Tom” ability.  
- Additionally, there is an original new character conceived exclusively for Tekken—a character never before seen or played, still in development.  
  - Although many are urging an early reveal, extensive research and development mean it will take time.

**DLC and Pass Information**  
- In the Season 2 Pass, there will be six DLC pieces: four characters and two stages, available in the Season 2 Character and Stage Pass, scheduled for sale on April 1st.  
- For those interested in characters only, a Season 2 Character Pass (featuring just the four characters) will also be available.

**Additional Presentation Details**  
- Some setting images have been provided for illustrators and cosplayers to use as reference. These will be covered in more detail later in the presentation.

# Gameplay Mechanics and Balance Adjustments

## The Heat System Enhancements

**Expanding Strategic Options**  
- We’re expanding the range of tactics using the Heat System. Some characters will now be able to perform both a Heat Smash and a Heat Burst from their unique stances, broadening combo possibilities and tactical attacks.

**New Input Options for Heat Activation**  
- Until now, after using a Heat activation technique, players could only run in a standing position. With the new changes, by moving the lever downward (toward positions 1, 2, or 3), you can now initiate a crouching state and approach your opponent, thereby offering two distinct offensive options.

**Video Demonstrations**  
- A video is presented showing Zafina performing a Heat Burst from her stance, followed by a Heat Smash.  
- Another video demonstrates Anna’s new approach—showing both a normal running pattern and an option to crouch and approach, giving players more tactical choices.

## Workshop Balance Adjustments

**Chip Damage Reduction**  
- The overall chip damage during the Heat state has been slightly reduced.  
- Additional chip damage incurred when using Heat Dash (especially when combined with guarding) has been adjusted.  
  - In Season 1, Heat Dash damage was 19; in Season 2, it’s set at 15.  
  - When opponents are in a register state, chip damage has been adjusted from 12 down to 4.  
- The goal is to prevent overly one-sided matchups and allow for longer, more strategic engagements.

**Power Crush and Offensive Techniques**  
- Previously, techniques mixing Power Crush and Heat activation (used by characters such as Nina and Asena) enabled strong counterattacks.  
- For Season 2, these mixed techniques will be reworked so that only the Power Crush aspect remains active, potentially reducing the effectiveness of certain defensive/offensive moves.

# Control Improvements and Movement Enhancements

**Crouching and Side Movement**  
- Previously, while crouching, you could not move toward the front of the screen. Now, moving sideways from a crouched position is possible, offering new defensive options.  
- This change helps players evade attacks that rely on predictable low movements.

**Pre-Input for Side Walking**  
- We’ve improved side walking by allowing pre-input. If you input the command slightly in advance, your character will perform the move as soon as possible.  
- A video demonstrates how side walking can now be initiated while guarding, resulting in smoother and more precise evasive maneuvers.

**Round-Start Input Buffer**  
- At the start of a round, there is now a slight input buffer that makes it easier to execute moves at the optimal moment.  
- Inspired by Tekken 1’s technique, this ensures that pressing a button just before the round starts yields the fastest possible move.

# Ranked Matches and Point System Overhaul

## “Season 2” Policy

1. Implement proper matchmaking **based on skill level**.  
2. Create a competitive and **fair point system**.  
3. Develop an environment that maintains goals and **ensures long-term enjoyment**.

## “Season 2” Changes

1. Mitigate **disparity in matchmaking**.  
2. Revise the ranked match **point system**.  
3. Implement **rank reset** / **adding new ranks**.

---

## Mitigate “Disparity in Matchmaking”

### **Update 1: Change in Matchmaking Logic**  
- In Season 2, **“Tekken Power”** is no longer used for matchmaking.  
- Instead, the system considers the **“highest rank”** among all your characters for matchmaking purposes.

### **Update 2: Specification Changes for Rank Promotion**  
- Adjust the timing of rank promotion for secondary (sub) characters.  
- Modify the rank assignment after promotion.  

**Season 1 Examples**  
- Raijin (22 dan) → Garyu (15 dan)  
- Tekken Emperor (26 dan) → Flame Ruler (19 dan)  

**Season 2 Examples**  
- Fujin (21 dan) → Mighty Ruler (18 dan)  
- Tekken King (25 dan) → Fujin (21 dan)

### **Update 3: Addition of Search Filters**  
- A **“Same Rank Only”** option is added to search filters to enhance matchmaking precision.  
- A **“Rank Restriction”** option is also added in Quick Match filters.

---

## Revise the Ranked Match Point System

### **Update 4: Improve Point Adjustments**  
- Adjust point fluctuation based on match outcomes to better reflect actual skill differences.  
- Recalibrate the required points for each rank, making progression more meaningful.

**Point Fluctuation Comparison**  
|                                 | **WIN**                                                | **LOSE**                                        |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Against Higher-Rank Opponent** | **Season 1:** Medium → **Season 2:** Large            | **Season 1 & 2:** Small                         |
| **Against Lower-Rank Opponent**  | **Season 1 & 2:** Small                               | **Season 1:** Medium → **Season 2:** Large      |

### **Update 5: Removal of the “Consecutive Loss Penalty”**  
- Remove the system that previously imposed larger point losses after three consecutive defeats at certain ranks.  
- Make point reductions more consistent, regardless of loss streaks.

### **Update 6: Enhancement of the “Winning Streak Bonus”**  
- Modify the winning streak bonus to accelerate rank progression for skilled players.  
- Ensure that strong players can reach their appropriate rank more efficiently.

**Winning Streak Bonus Comparison**  
- **Season 1:**  
  - For “Blue Ranks” and above, additional bonus points were granted every three consecutive wins.  
- **Season 2:**  
  - For “Red Ranks” and below, bonus points kick in from just two consecutive victories and scale upward.

### **Update 7: Refinement of the “Promotion Bonus”**  
- Improve the system to prevent unintended advantages from repeated rank fluctuation.  
- Promotion bonuses will be granted in a more controlled manner, avoiding exploit loops.

## Implement Rank Reset / Adding New Ranks

### **Update 8: Adjustment of Starting Ranks (Rank Reset)**  
- Your Season 2 starting rank is determined by the highest rank you achieved in **Season 1**, referencing the rank you held just before the Season 2 maintenance.  
- Special “Season 1 Reward Titles” will be awarded based on your final highest rank in Season 1 (e.g., Tekken King [1st Season Title]).

**Rank Reset Table**

| **Season 1 Highest Rank**                                                              | **Season 2 Starting Rank**                                               |

# Ghost Mode and Future Interactive Features

- The goal is a more interactive experience, letting you and friends watch or bet on ghost battles, especially once your ghost is trained to your style.

# Community, Tournaments, and Closing Remarks

## Tournament Regulations and Match Environment
